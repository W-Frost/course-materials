Code is for scanning an amount of ports to see whether they are open or closed. This is done using workers piping into channels which is then
deciphered into two seperate array lists for open and closed. These arrays are then printed out for the user to see which are open and which 
ones are closed. The tests are to simply check if the correct amount of open ports (this test has to be changed for each machine one for instance
on campus it is 2 for at home it is 1) have been passed and the other test is to show how many ports
there are in total.

The changes I made to this code is I changed the order in which the displayed output is presented. I also added the functionality of using an int to the 
PortScanner() function so that it can accept an int and work in the same way as before. I also updated the tests so that it works at home.
